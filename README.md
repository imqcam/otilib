# OVERVIEW #

**OTILIB** 

This is the repository for the implementation of Order Truncated Imaginary numbers (OTI numbers) in different programming languages. OTI algebra is the extension from the imaginary numbers perspective to the Truncated Taylor Polynomials. They provide a concise extension of the Dual numbers ($a+b\epsilon,\;\epsilon^2=0$) and are applicable to computing high order derivatives computer programmed functions

## Current Programming languages: 
* **C**
* **Python (3 or newer)**

The following programming languages are to be implemented in a near future:

* Fortran
* C++

Other welcome implementations for further utilization of the method:

* Java / Javascript
* Matlab
* Julia
